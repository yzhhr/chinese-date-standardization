Do `npm install` and everything like that... I bet you already know

This is a project to standardize date(year-month-day) information from a xlsx file.

The code is designed in a way that is **friendly for adding more rules** to the matching process as it offers a visual report of what is matched and what is not.

It also implements a **double-check** to ensure every result you get is in good format.

The specific patterns in this code is oriented for the original data, which I cannot upload, which explains why the regex's are so messy - users are just unpredictable.

Hope you **provide adequate regex check when your user inputs**, or there will be a disaster like this and you have to waste a terrible amount of time fixing it.
